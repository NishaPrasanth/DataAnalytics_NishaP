## Overview

Cyclistic, a prominent bike-share company headquartered in Chicago, has
rapidly gained traction in the city's transportation landscape. In an
effort to delve deeper into their customer base and refine their
marketing strategies, Cyclistic seeks to understand the distinct
behaviors and preferences of casual riders versus annual members.

The company recognizes the need to tailor its marketing approach to
effectively convert casual riders into committed annual members. By
leveraging data-driven insights, Cyclistic aims to develop a
comprehensive understanding of how these two customer segments interact
with their services differently.

**Business Task**

The objective of this business task is to develop a comprehensive
marketing strategy for Cyclistic that addresses the distinct needs and
behaviors of both annual members and casual riders. By answering the
following three questions, we aim to optimize marketing efforts,
increase customer engagement, and drive conversions from casual riders
to annual members.

-   ***Understanding Usage Patterns***: Analyze Cyclistic's dataset to
    identify differences in how annual members and casual riders utilize
    Cyclistic bikes.

**Data Background**

The dataset was acquired from click here
![Link](https://divvytripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) *Motivate
International Inc* made the data available under this
![license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

For this project, I downloaded data for twelve months (January to
December 2020). The zipped CSVs were downloaded and unzipped into a
folder.

Below shown the dataset of a *cyclistic biketrip data for the year
2020*.The dataset has *3541683* rows and *13* column.

Due to the large size of data we use *R* to analyse effectively.

## R Programming

-   ***Loading Packages*** The R package is a collection of R functions,
    data sets, and compiled code that extends the functionality of R.
    Here we use four packages to analyse the data.

![Load Packages](C:\Users\home\Documents\package.PNG)

In R, the *library()* function is used to load R packages into your
current R session

```{r}
library (tidyverse)
library (janitor)
library (lubridate)
library (scales)
rm(list=ls())
```

-   **Read CSV file**

Below given are the year ***2020 dataset** of cyclistic bike share
program* which are downloaded and saved as CSV files. Here
***read.csv()*** is used for reading the csv files.

```{r}
df1 <- read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
df2 <-  read.csv("202004.csv")
df3 <- read.csv("202005.csv")
df4 <- read.csv("202006.csv")
df5<- read.csv("202007.csv")
df6 <- read.csv("202008.csv")
df7 <- read.csv("202009.csv")
df8 <- read.csv("202010.csv")
df9 <- read.csv("202011.csv")
df10 <- read.csv("202012.csv")
df20 <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7,df8,df9,df10)
```

In R, the ***head()*** function is used to view the first few rows of a
data frame or a matrix. It allows you to quickly inspect the structure
and content of your data without displaying the entire dataset.

```{r}
head(df20)
```

-   **Cleaning Data**

***Janitor*** is an R package that provides a set of functions to clean
and preprocess data in R data frames

```{r}
df20_cleanedcols <- janitor::remove_empty(df20,which =c("cols"))
df20_cleanedrows <- janitor::remove_empty(df20,which =c("rows"))
dim(df20_cleanedcols)
dim(df20_cleanedrows)
```

-   **Removing duplicates and NA values**

```{r}
df20_clean <- na.omit(df20)
# for unique and removing duplicates 
unique(df20_clean)
dim(df20_clean)
df20_clean <- df20_clean %>% filter(df20_clean$start_station_name!=" ")
```

-   **Organising Data**

*Lubridate* is an R package designed to make it easier to work with
dates and times in R. It provides a set of functions that simplify
common tasks such as parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates and
times.we use parse date *ymd_hms()* and *as.Date()* for changing the
Started_at and ended_at column format.

![Check](C:\Users\home\Documents\char.PNG)

![changed](C:\Users\home\Documents\POXIXCT.PNG)

***Difftime()*** is used for calculating the difference in time. This
helps us to find and analyse the duration of each ride.

```{r}

##convert time and date
df <- df20_clean
#date
df$started_date <- as.Date(df$started_at)
df$ended_date <- as.Date(df$ended_at)
#time as  hours and minutes
df$started_at <- lubridate::ymd_hms(df$started_at)
df$ended_at <- lubridate::ymd_hms(df$ended_at)

df$start_hour <-lubridate::hour(df$started_at)
df$ended_hour <-lubridate::hour(df$ended_at)

df$Hours <- difftime(df$ended_at,df$started_at,units = c("hours"))
df$Minutes <- difftime(df$ended_at,df$started_at,units = c("mins"))

df <- df %>% 
  filter(Minutes>0)

View(df)

```

Dim function ***dim(df)*** retrieve or set the dimensions of an object,
such as a matrix or an array.

Here's how it works:

```{r}
dim(df)
```

-   **Summarize the data**

```{r}
df2 <- df %>% 
    group_by(weekly = floor_date(started_date,"week"),start_hour) %>% 
    summarise(Minutes = sum(Minutes), 
              mean = mean(Minutes),Max = max(Minutes),
              min = min(Minutes),count = n()) %>% 
              ungroup()
 
```

```{r}
View(df2)
```

Here how it looks like
![Time](C:\Users\home\Documents\time%20change.PNG)

```{r}

summary(df2$count)
```

```{r}
#table of counts by hours
xtabs(df2$count~df2$start_hour)

```

```{r}
#table of count by months
df2$Monthy <- lubridate::month(df2$weekly)
```

-   **Data Visualisation**

The *ggplot()* function is the primary function used in the ggplot2
package, a popular data visualization package in R. It is used to create
and customize plots based on a grammar of graphics approach, allowing
users to create complex and highly customizable visualizations with
relatively simple syntax.

Here's how the ggplot() workes to calculate

1.  ***Rides Done on Per Day***

```{r}
#hourly count per ride
df2 %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x=weekly,y=count))+ scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
  labs(title = "Count of rides per day", y = "Rides per hour")
```

2.  ***Calculating Average Ride Rer Day***

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x=weekly,y=count))+ scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
  labs(title = "Count of rides per day", subtitle = "based on 28 day moving average", y = "Avg rides per day")


```

-   *Summarise data with ridable_type*

```{r}
df_biketype <- df %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,rideable_type,weekly = floor_date(started_date,"week")) %>% 
  summarise(Minutes = sum(Minutes), 
            mean = mean(Minutes),Max = max(Minutes),
            min = min(Minutes),count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

```

```{r}
#summary of hourly count
summary(df2$count)

```

**3. *No of Rides Done on Per month***

```{r}
#table of counts by hours
xtabs(df2$count~df2$start_hour)
```

```{r}
#table of count by months
df2$Monthy <- lubridate::month(df2$weekly)
df2 %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x=weekly,y=count))+ scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
  labs(title = "Count of rides per week", y = "Rides per hour")
```

**4. *Ride variation between member Vs Casual***

```{r}
df_biketype <- df %>% 
  group_by(member_casual,rideable_type,weekly = floor_date(started_date,"week")) %>% 
  summarise(Minutes = sum(Minutes), 
            mean = mean(Minutes),Max = max(Minutes),
            min = min(Minutes),count = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()
View(df_biketype)
```

![biketype](C:\Users\home\Documents\type.PNG)

```{r}
#count by rider type
  
  ggplot(data = df_biketype) + geom_area( aes(x=weekly,y=count,fill = member_casual))+scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
    labs(title = "Count of rides by rider type")
```

**5*.Understanding Most Bike type Usage***

```{r}
#count by bike type (total by week)

  ggplot(df_biketype) + geom_area(aes(x=weekly,y=count,fill = rideable_type))+ scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)+
    labs(title = "Count of rides by bike type",subtitle = "For the count of 12 months")
```

***6. Identifying Top 20 station with Higher Ride Count***

```{r}
df %>% count(start_station_name,sort = TRUE) %>% top_n(20)
```

```{r}
# top 20start station by ride count
   df %>% count(start_station_name,sort = TRUE) %>% top_n(20) %>% ggplot()+geom_col(aes(x=reorder(start_station_name,n),y=n))+
  coord_flip()+labs(title = "Top 20 start stations by ride count", y = "station name",x="count of rides")+ scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
    
```

### **Key Findings**

-   ***Streeter Dr & Grand Ave*** has the large ride count as
    ***34984.***

-   Casual riders have the ride count more than members. marking the
    ***summer months of April to September*** where the most ride have
    happened.

-   Maximum ***docker bikes*** are used by both riders. In summer the
    riders have maximized.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis output indicating a high ride count at Streeter Dr
& Grand Ave, with casual riders outnumbering members and peak ride
activity during the summer months, as well as the utilization of maximum
docker bikes by both rider groups, the marketing strategy team can
implement the following recommendations:

1.  **Targeted Summer Campaigns**: Launch targeted marketing campaigns
    during the summer months, especially from April to September, to
    capitalize on the peak ride activity. Focus on promoting Cyclistic's
    services and memberships to casual riders, highlighting the benefits
    of biking during the warmer seasons, such as enjoying the outdoors
    and avoiding traffic congestion.

2.  **Membership Incentives**: Offer special incentives and promotions
    to encourage casual riders to sign up for annual memberships.
    Highlight the cost-effectiveness and convenience of becoming a
    Cyclistic member, especially during periods of high bike usage like
    summer, when demand for rentals is at its peak.

3.  **Enhanced Docking Stations**: Ensure that docking stations,
    especially at popular locations like Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, are
    well-maintained and stocked with a sufficient number of bikes,
    including maximum docker bikes. This will improve the overall user
    experience and make it easier for both casual riders and members to
    access bikes when needed.

4.  **Social Media Engagement**: Leverage social media platforms to
    engage with potential customers and promote Cyclistic's services.
    Share user-generated content, testimonials, and tips for biking in
    the city during the summer months. Encourage followers to become
    members and take advantage of exclusive benefits.

5.  **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Continuously analyze ride data to
    identify trends and patterns in bike usage. Use this information to
    refine marketing strategies, optimize bike distribution, and make
    data-driven decisions that enhance the overall effectiveness of
    Cyclistic's services.

By implementing these recommendations, the marketing strategy team can
effectively capitalize on the high ride count at Streeter Dr & Grand
Ave, increase membership conversions among casual riders, and maximize
the utilization of Cyclistic's bike rental service during the summer
months.
